# big_eyes

## Description
Instead of using Javascript logic to enact certain physics animations, these CSS animated eyes and background colors are entirely dependent on mouse movement instead. It is a simple demonstration of how one can change the behaiviour of a page based on user input instead of predetermined logic statements or other Javascript independent of the user.

## How to Run
To run this on your any computer simply open the link and begin moving the mouse. The eyes will track your mouse and the backgound color will change depending on where your mouse is located.

## Roadmap
In the future I would like to add more functionality to the background than just the simple colorshift. Some inspirations have been a parallax effect, or maybe even some streaming colors to folor the mouse.
